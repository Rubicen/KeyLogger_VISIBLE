# KeyLogger_VISIBLE
A keylogger that is safe (All visible all the time, no hidden scam stuff) that I set up to be able to test a touch screen so it built mainly around the touchscreen pickups more than just keys

If you find anythingoff about this or want anything added let me know, might have time to fix this up more in the future
